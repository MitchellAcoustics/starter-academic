subtitle: DEep Learning Techniques for noise Annoyance detection
date: 2021-01-17T13:45:04.509Z
summary: Funded by a UCL Health of the Public small grant, the DeLTA project
  aims to develop deep learning methods for predicting annoyance perception of
  various urban sounds. It is based on an online survey of annoyance ratings and
  complex sound labelling of a large-scale database of binaural recordings. The
  project is based at the UCL Institute for Environmental Design and
  Engineering, lead by Dr. Francesco Aletta, and the Department of Statistical
  Science, lead by Dr. Jinghao Xue.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports environmental noise as the second most important cause of ill health in Europe (behind only air pollution). It is a major public health issue that can lead to negative cardiovascular and metabolic effects, reduced cognitive performance in children, as well as severe annoyance and sleep disturbance. Long-term exposure to environmental noise is estimated to cause 12k+ premature deaths and to contribute to 48k+ new cases of ischemic heart disease per year, in Europe alone. The WHO estimates that 22M people suffer chronic high annoyance, which is associated with specific outdoor sources of environmental noise. Dose-response curves are indeed available in literature to estimate such effects (e.g., aircraft noise eliciting proportionally more annoyance than road traffic noise, which is in turn more annoying than railway noise, etc.). In the urban realm, monitoring noise levels is not sufficient, as single-number metrics (e.g., decibels) do not provide insights into the types of noise sources present in a given acoustic environment and have proven inadequate for characterising the impact of urban noise on public health. In a smart city context, even if a pervasive network of noise monitoring sensors could record audio signals, it would be impossible to determine the presence of annoying sources, as this would require “human listening”. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be trained to extract information about presence and prominence of potentially annoying noise sources in a specific soundscape starting from the audio signal (i.e., spectrogram and waveform). The current proposal has the additional value of making use of datasets and equipment used/acquired in recent projects, capitalizing on research resources coming from different funding streams.
