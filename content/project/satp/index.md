summary: The long-term objective of the Soundscape Attributes Translation Project (SATP) is to generate validated translations of soundscape attributes using standardized listening experiments in different languages and geographical regions as a way to promote a widespread use of the soundscape attributes, both in academia and practice, across locations, populations and languages.

The recently published ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 standard aims to provide researchers and practitioners around the world with a reliable questionnaire for soundscape characterization. The ISO Technical Specifications report protocols and attributes grounded in the soundscape literature, but only includes an English version. The applicability and reliability of these attributes in non-English speaking regions remains an open question, as research investigating translations of soundscape attributes is limited. To address this gap, an international collaboration was initiated with soundscape researchers from all over the world. Translation into 15 different languages, obtained through focus groups and panels of experts in soundscape studies, are proposed. The long-term objective is to validate the proposed translations using standardized listening experiments in different languages and geographical regions as a way to promote a widespread use of the soundscape attributes, both in academia and practice, across locations, populations and languages.

In addition, I, along with several of my colleagues, will be a Guest Editor of a [Special Issue of Applied Acoustics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/applied-acoustics/call-for-papers/special-issue-on-soundscape-attributes-translation-current-projects-and-challenges) entitled "Soundscape Attributes Translation: Current Projects and Challenges"
