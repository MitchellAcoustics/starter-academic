Andrew Mitchell is a Research Fellow in urban soundscape modelling at University College London (UCL). His research interests include soundscape analysis and visualisation, machine learning, and human perception of complex sounds. Andrew has been awarded two PhD and one Post-doctoral [Enrichment Awards](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/enrichment-students/andrew-mitchell) from The Alan Turing Institute and spent a month in early 2022 as a visiting research fellow at Stockholm University. His ongoing projects include the [Soundscape Indices (SSID) Horizon 2020](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/environmental-design/research-projects/2022/jun/soundscape-indices-ssid) project, [Soundscapy](https://github.com/MitchellAcoustics/Soundscapy), [Deep Learning Techniques for noise Annoyance detection](https://andrew-mitchell.netlify.app/project/delta/) (DeLTA), AI for Urban Soundscape Enhancement (AI USE), the [Catalogue of Soundscape Interventions](https://soundscape-intervention.org/catalogue/) (CSI), and the [Soundscape Attributes Translation Project](https://andrew-mitchell.netlify.app/project/satp/) (SATP).

Andrew is also the host of *[The Rest is Just Noise](https://www.justnoisepod.com)*, a monthly podcast exploring the relationship between sound and our cities. Each episode, Andrew and his co-hosts and colleagues Dr Francesco Aletta and Dr Tin Oberman speak with researchers and experts from a wide range of backgrounds about their work in urban sounds and sound perception.
