## Go to Joel First

[Joel Eduardo Martinez has compiled a fantastic list](https://joelemartinez.com/2015/07/14/mixed-effect-models/) of resources for mixed effects modelling. This is the first stop for a library of information on the topic, but I'd like to compile my own set and add to what he has already done. I'll also be adding any talks or tutorials I write on the topic
