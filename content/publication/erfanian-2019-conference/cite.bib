 abstract = {The soundscape, conceived as the acoustic equivalent of landscape, is defined by ISO 12913-1 as the human's perception of the acoustic environment, in context, including accompanying physiological and psychological responses. The emerging body of research is synthesized with studies explicitly designed to investigate soundscape at the ‘unconscious' level in an effort to more specifically conceptualize soundscape. The purpose of this review is to initially report the existing research on soundscape in the neurophysiology and physiology domains and secondly, to underline what the field has achieved so far in the areas of physiology and neurophysiology. Finally, a brief discussion of the future research agenda is discussed toward the development of a neurophysiological and physiological model of soundscape associated with perceptual attributes in the context of public health and wellbeing. For this review web of science, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for peer-reviewed articles published in English with the combinations of the keywords ‘soundscape', ‘noise sensitivity', ‘physiology', and ‘neurophysiology'. The previous preliminary research suggests that essentially the physiological responses attributed to soundscape correspond with how they are subjectively perceived, while the evoked physiological responses differ in terms of valence. These variations may indicate a brain-based differentiation among the processing substrates of different sound types. Additionally, the emerging body of research implies gender-related differences in evoked physiological responses of the soundscape. Understanding the physiological and neurophysiological basis of soundscape creates a beneficial foundation for urban sound-related problems, leading to a robust impact on urban policy-making in terms of soundscape prediction, design, and standardization. 2},
