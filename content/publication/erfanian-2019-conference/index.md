abstract: The soundscape, conceived as the acoustic equivalent of landscape, is defined
  by ISO 12913-1 as the human's perception of the acoustic environment, in context,
  including accompanying physiological and psychological responses. The emerging body
  of research is synthesized with studies explicitly designed to investigate soundscape
  at the ‘unconscious' level in an effort to more specifically conceptualize soundscape.
  The purpose of this review is to initially report the existing research on soundscape
  in the neurophysiology and physiology domains and secondly, to underline what the
  field has achieved so far in the areas of physiology and neurophysiology. Finally,
  a brief discussion of the future research agenda is discussed toward the development
  of a neurophysiological and physiological model of soundscape associated with perceptual
  attributes in the context of public health and wellbeing. For this review web of
  science, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for peer-reviewed articles published in
  English with the combinations of the keywords ‘soundscape', ‘noise sensitivity',
  ‘physiology', and ‘neurophysiology'. The previous preliminary research suggests
  that essentially the physiological responses attributed to soundscape correspond
  with how they are subjectively perceived, while the evoked physiological responses
  differ in terms of valence. These variations may indicate a brain-based differentiation
  among the processing substrates of different sound types. Additionally, the emerging
  body of research implies gender-related differences in evoked physiological responses
  of the soundscape. Understanding the physiological and neurophysiological basis
  of soundscape creates a beneficial foundation for urban sound-related problems,
  leading to a robust impact on urban policy-making in terms of soundscape prediction,
  design, and standardization. 2
