abstract: The field of soundscape studies considers sound environments as perceived,
  in context, and has recently focussed on understanding the potential of physical
  acoustical features, including temporal characteristics, for predicting human perception.
  This study investigates the presence of a 1/f structure in the power spectrum slope
  of six (psycho)acoustical parameters of 30-s recordings of urban acoustic environments.
  The acoustical parameters were calculated as time series throughout the recording
  period, then the power spectrum of the time series was calculated and plotted on
  a log-log scale, with the x-axis ranging from 30 s/10-1.5 Hz to 0.01 s/102 Hz. The
  slope of the best-fitted straight line through the power spectrum was calculated
  and compared to the corresponding perceptual attribute ratings of the soundscape
  collected on site during the recording. The dataset includes 300 + recording-response
  pairs. An overall 1/f structure was not found for any of the parameters. Differences
  in temporal behaviour are indicated at different time scales, with a deviation in
  slope typically occurring at âˆ¼2 s/0.5 Hz, reflecting differences in temporal behaviour
  among within-sound-event time scales and between-sound-event time scales. An ordinal
  logistic regression model is developed which predicts the perceptual attributes
  of urban soundscapes based on the spectral slopes of the acoustic time series.
