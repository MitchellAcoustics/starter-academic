abstract: The implementation of lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 outbreak has
  resulted in wide-ranging social and environmental implications. Among the environmental
  impacts is a decrease in urban noise levels which has so far been observed at the
  city scale via noise mapping efforts conducted through the framework of the Environmental
  Noise Directive. This study aims to understand how lockdown measures have manifested
  at a local level to better determine how the person-level experience of the urban
  soundscape has been affected and how these affects differ across urban space typologies.
  Taking London as a case study, a series of 30-second binaural recordings were taken
  at 11 locations representing a cross-section of urban public spaces with varying
  compositions of sound sources during Spring 2019 (pre-lockdown, N = 620) and Spring
  2020 (during-lockdown, N = 481). Five acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics (LAeq,
  LA10, LA90, Loudness, Sharpness) were calculated for each recording and their changes
  from the pre-lockdown scenario to the lockdown scenario are investigated. Clustering
  analysis was performed which grouped the locations into 3 types of urban settings
  based on their acoustic characteristics. An average reduction of 5.4 dB (LAeq) was
  observed, however significant differences in the degree of reduction were found
  across the locations, ranging from a 10.7 dB to a 1.2 dB reduction. This study confirms
  the general reduction in noise levels due to the nationally imposed lockdown measures,
  identifies trends which vary depending on the urban context and discusses the implications
  for the limits of urban noise reduction.
