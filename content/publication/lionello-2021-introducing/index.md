abstract: 'Likert scales are useful for collecting data on attitudes and perceptions
  from large samples of people. In particular, they have become a well-established
  tool in soundscape studies for conducting in situ surveys to determine how people
  experience urban public spaces. However, it is still unclear whether the metrics
  of the scales are consistently interpreted during a typical assessment task. The
  current work aims at identifying some general trends in the interpretation of Likert
  scale metrics and introducing a procedure for the derivation of metric corrections
  by analyzing a case study dataset of 984 soundscape assessments across 11 urban
  locations in London. According to ISO/TS 12913-2:2018, soundscapes can be assessed
  through the scaling of 8 dimensions: pleasant, annoying, vibrant, monotonous, eventful,
  uneventful, calm, and chaotic. The hypothesis underlying this study is that a link
  exists between correlations across the percentage of assessments falling in each
  Likert scale category and a dilation/compression factor affecting the interpretation
  of the scales metric. The outcome of this metric correction value derivation is
  introduced for soundscape, and a new projection of the London soundscapes according
  to the corrected circumplex space is compared with the initial ISO circumplex space.
  The overall results show a general non-equidistant interpretation of the scales,
  particularly on the vibrant-monotonous direction. The implications of this correction
  have been demonstrated through a Linear Ridge Classifier task for predicting the
  London soundscape responses using objective acoustic parameters, which shows significant
  improvement when applied to the corrected data. The results suggest that the corrected
  values account for the non-equidistant interpretation of the Likert metrics, thereby
  allowing mathematical operations to be viable when applied to the data.'
