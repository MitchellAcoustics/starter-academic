abstract: 'A protocol for characterizing urban soundscapes for use in the design of
  Soundscape Indices (SSID) and general urban research as implemented under the European
  Research Council (ERC)-funded SSID project is described in detail. The protocol
  consists of two stages: (1) a Recording Stage to collect audio-visual recordings
  for further analysis and for use in laboratory experiments, and (2) a Questionnaire
  Stage to collect in situ soundscape assessments via a questionnaire method paired
  with acoustic data collection. Key adjustments and improvements to previous methodologies
  for soundscape characterization have been made to enable the collation of data gathered
  from research groups around the world. The data collected under this protocol will
  form a large-scale, international soundscape database.'
