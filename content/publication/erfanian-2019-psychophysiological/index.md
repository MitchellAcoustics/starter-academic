abstract: The soundscape is defined by the International Standard Organization (ISO)
  12913-1 as the human's perception of the acoustic environment, in context, accompanying
  physiological and psychological responses. Previous research is synthesized with
  studies designed to investigate soundscape at the ‘unconscious' level in an effort
  to more specifically conceptualize biomarkers of the soundscape. This review aims
  firstly, to investigate the consistency of methodologies applied for the investigation
  of physiological aspects of soundscape; secondly, to underline the feasibility of
  physiological markers as biomarkers of soundscape; and finally, to explore the association
  between the physiological responses and the well-founded psychological components
  of the soundscape which are continually advancing. For this review, Web of Science,
  PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO were searched for peer-reviewed articles published
  in English with combinations of the keywords ‘soundscape', ‘environmental noise/sound',
  ‘physiology/physiological', ‘psychology/psychological', and ‘perceptual attributes/affective/subjective
  assessment/appraisals'. Previous research suggests that Electrocardiography (ECG)
  and Vectorcardiography (VCG) biometrics quantifying Heart Rate (HR), stimulus-locked
  experimental design, and passive listening with homogeneous populations are predominantly
  applied to characterize the psychophysiology underlying the soundscape. Pleasantness
  and arousal are the most frequent psychological descriptors for soundscape subjective
  appraisals. Likewise, acoustic environments are reported to inconsistently evoke
  physiological responses with great variability among studies. The link between the
  perceptual attributes and physiological responses of soundscape vary within and
  among existing literature. While a few studies detected a link between physiological
  manifestations of soundscape and the perceptual attributes, the others failed to
  validate this link. Additionally, the majority of the study findings were limited
  to one or two physiological responses.
