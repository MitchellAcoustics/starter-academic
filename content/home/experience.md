        As part of the Soundscape Indices (SSID) research team, I am primarily responsible for the development of machine learning models, data management and publication, and industry collaborations. My projects and appointments include:
         * A generalisable prediction model for urban soundscape perception
         * [`Soundscapy`](https://github.com/MitchellAcoustics/Soundscapy) an open-source Python package for soundscape data analysis and visualisation
         * Collaborations with The Alan Turing Institute and industrial partners
         * Maintain the [International Soundscape Database (ISD)](https://www.zenodo.org/record/6331810), the Soundscape Attributes Translation Database, and the DeLTA Database

        Primary research responsibility is to investigate machine learning and regression modelling of soundscapes based on acoustical and non-acoustical factors. As a team member on the SSID project group, practical responsibilities include:
        
        * Coordinate collaboration with industrial and research partners to promote the implementation of Soundscape in practice
        * Design and implement a methodology framework for conducting soundscape assessments for use in research across the world
        * Conduct soundscape recordings (comprising spatial audio, 360 degree video, sound level meter measurements, and in-depth questionnaires) at 40+ locations around the UK, US and Europe
        * Developed the database and data structure for the storage and publication of a large-scale soundscape recording database.

        As part of an extensive industry collaboration, my role was to provide leading edge insights from modern research on soundscapes and sound perception to better inform the design of the built environment. I also lead the development of a unique and innovative method for assessing the sound experience of building occupants and worked toward designing a comprehensive soundscape rating metric. This project required:
        * Management of a suite of environmental quality meters
        * Development of a bespoke occupant survey app
        * Development of custom acoustic analysis tools and software
        * Independent project management and technical service package development
