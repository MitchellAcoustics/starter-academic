title: The spectral structure of acoustic time series can predict the perceptual
  assessment of urban soundscapes
abstract: The field of soundscape studies considers sound environments as
  perceived, in context, and has recently focussed on understanding the
  potential of physical acoustical features, including temporal characteristics,
  for predicting human perception. This study investigates the presence of a 1/f
  structure in the power spectrum slope of six (psycho)acoustical parameters of
  30-second recordings of urban acoustic environments. The acoustical parameters
  were calculated as time series throughout the recording period, then the power
  spectrum of the time series was calculated and plotted on a log-log scale,
  with the x-axis ranging from 30s/10-1.5 Hz to 0.01s/102 Hz. The slope of the
  best-fitted straight line through the power spectrum was calculated and
  compared to the corresponding perceptual attribute ratings of the soundscape
  collected on site during the recording. The dataset includes 300+
  recording-response pairs. An overall 1/f structure was not found for any of
  the parameters. Differences in temporal behaviour are indicated at different
  time scales, with a deviation in slope typically occurring at ~2s/0.5 Hz,
  reflecting differences in temporal behaviour among within-sound-event time
  scales and between-sound-event time scales. An ordinal logistic regression
  model is developed which predicts the perceptual attributes of urban
  soundscapes based on the spectral slopes of the acoustic time series.
