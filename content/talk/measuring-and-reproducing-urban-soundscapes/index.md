title: Measuring and Reproducing Urban Soundscapes
abstract: Given the multi-sensory nature of urban soundscapes, researchers who
  aim to study them must deal with a large and varied amount of data in order to
  fully characterise them. To better understand how people actually perceive
  their urban sound environments, we must conduct large scale in situ surveys
  and pair these with techniques like ambisonic audio recordings, 360 degree
  video, calibrated SLM measurements, and weather data. We have developed a
  protocol for carrying out theses surveys which enables an individual's sound
  exposure to be directly compared to their soundscape perception. We have put
  this protocol into practice to create a large-scale international database
  which includes more than 2,500 surveys spanning 8 cities across Europe and
  China. In this presentation, I will discuss how we go about measuring urban
  soundscapes, the equipment we use to characterise their environment, and how
  we can reproduce and analyse the primary aspects of the soundscapes within a
  lab setting.
