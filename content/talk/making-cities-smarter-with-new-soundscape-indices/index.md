title: Making cities smarter with new soundscape indices
abstract: The core objectives of smart city design are to increase quality of
  life, enhance efficiency, and move towards the sustainability of cities. While
  this will involve increased integration of new and smarter technologies into
  urban design, the implementation of these technologies as applied to acoustics
  should be made within a design approach which considers these core objectives.
  Soundscape strategies have a focus on people’s perception and experience,
  considering the many factors which influence their perception. A recognized
  demand in the field of soundscape is a new set of metrics that can reliably
  measure both the acoustic environment and its perception. The European
  Research Council acknowledged this need and recently funded the Advanced Grant
  project “Soundscape Indices” (SSID), which aims at providing more advanced
  tools, compared to conventional dB-based metrics, by taking into account
  psychological, (psycho)acoustical, neurophysiological, and contextual factors
  for soundscape assessment. The SSID project will - characterise soundscapes,
  by capturing acoustic environments and establishing a comprehensive database;
  identify key factors and their influence on soundscape quality based on the
  database, by conducting laboratory psychological evaluations,
  acoustical/psychoacoustic factors analysis; and research the neural and
  psychophysiological underpinnings of soundscape experience. It is expected
  that SSID will provide a vital tool in guiding the implementation of the
  technological infrastructure of smart cities.
