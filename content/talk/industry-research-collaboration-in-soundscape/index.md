title: Industry and Research Collaboration in Soundscapes
abstract: The IOA Early Careers Group and UKAN+ Early Career Special Interest Group are pleased to invite everyone to a session on effective collaboration between academia and industry, followed by a panel talk on such collaboration and future research and innovation. The session on effective collaboration will include talks from Prof Barry Gibbs (University of Liverpool), Nick Sheppard (Thales), Dr Antonio Torija Martinez (University of Salford), and Andrew Mitchell (UCL). Each speaker will draw from their own experiences, through knowledge transfer partnerships, funded research projects and collaborative projects, to focus on what makes for effective and successful collaboration. Following the presentations there will be a panel discussion, opened by Kirill Horoshenkov (Professor of Acoustics, University of Sheffield), which will begin by outlining the recent UKAN survey on research priorities, followed by a wider discussion regarding effective collaboration between academia and industry and innovation and future research from the perspective of each of the speakers.
