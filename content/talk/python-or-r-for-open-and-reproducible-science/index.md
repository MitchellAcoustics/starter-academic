title: Python (or R) for Open and Reproducible Science
abstract: >
  Programming languages like Python and R are powerful tools for data analysis,
  but how can they help enable more open science? In this brief intro, I’ll walk
  through some basics for using Python to expand your data analysis, how it can
  provide more consistency in your own research, and why sharing data and code
  is good for your own workflow and for future research. Beyond just introducing
  the concepts below, I’ll share the tools that make open data science so
  powerful and examples of how we make use of it in our work at UCL and the
  Turing Institute.


  Automated and repeatable data processing – replacing SPSS with R and Python

  Sharing data and code – how does this work in practice and how do we make it as accessible as possible?

  Future proof, collaborative, and free
