title: The Soundscape Indices (SSID) Protocol - A method for practical
  soundscape assessments in the city
abstract: >
  With the progress in standardization in soundscape studies and interest in
  predicting changes in soundscape perception, practical methods for carrying
  out repeated and large-scale surveys are required.  A protocol for
  characterising urban soundscapes has been developed which enables direct
  comparisons of an individualâ€™s sound exposure to their soundscape perception.
  Key adjustments and improvements to previous methodologies for soundscape
  characterization have been made to enable the efficient and organised
  management of data. This protocol has been put into practice to create a
  large-scale, international soundscape database and has been subsequently
  revised and refined to develop recommended best practices. This presentation
  will demonstrate the protocol and present initial results which show the
  variation in the degree and direction of correlations between acoustic metrics
  and perception across locations.

Doctoral researcher Andrew Mitchell gives an introduction to a new method for collecting large-scale soundscape assessments, developed by the SSID team at UCL. This protocol focusses on gathering a comprehensive set of data, both perceptual and objective, for characterising and studying the soundscape of an urban space. Paired with ambisonic audio recordings and 360 degree video for VR playback, this protocol allows for in depth and flexible soundscape research, at scale.
